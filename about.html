      <h3>I am Kyle J. Maxwell, a California-born but Colorado-raised asain designer. I love experiencing the immense city, with the urban art that is all around, and the unique style of clothing. I currently am a broke college student, scrounging around for any designing gig I can get, but wouldn't want to be doing anything else.</h3>

      <p>I was about 12 years old when I started getting into fashion and brands. I wanted to be cool, with the new popular brand. When my 12 year old self had an epiphany, we are paying for someone else's name, someone else's designs. I didn't want to wear a brand name for a few months after that. Then my mom put it in persepctive for me by saying "To wear a brand is to support that person/company, that people are chasing their dreams by doing it. I didn't think much of it at the time but I started wearing brands with logos again.</p>
      <p>About freshman year, is when this new edgy graffiti artist came to light. Banksy was starting to make the news with his very controversial pieces. Redefining what everyone used to label as graffiti, into something more, into street art. When Banksy came up, a lot of other artist came into the spot light for me, including D*Face, Space Invader, and Shepard Fairey. To me, those people opened my eyes to the possibilities of marketing, and art.</p>
      <p>Graduating highschool in America is a big deal. Maybe for the reason that back when our parents graduated it guaranteed them a good job, or for the fact that this is when major life decisions happen. I had no clue what I really wanted to do, because I slacked off in highschool. I used to take all these different art classes, jewerly, photography, drawing, and even ceramics. I never did end up picking a median I liked most. So when it came to college I decided why not try and take my art skills to the next level, and that's where I'm at today. Trying to find the kind of art I love most, trying to make a mark on society.</p>
